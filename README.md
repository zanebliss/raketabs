# Raketabs

Automatically generate and manage crontab entries for scheduled rake tasks in
multiple code repositories at once. Instead of writing a replacement for cron,
the goal is to automate the management of entries in the crontab file for rake
tasks for you.

- Configure tasks with args and schedules
- Use syslog with tags and namespaces or redirect output to another file
- Preview changes
